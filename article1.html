<p>Greetings from the Michigan Club Squash Team!</p>
<p>We could not be more excited to present to you the first ever edition of the Michigan Club Squash Newsletter. Thank you for joining us! We hope that as we continue to grow and compete, more and more of our friends, family, and alumni will come along for the ride.</p>
<p>As many of you know, our club was formed only two years ago, but in a short period of time we have come a long way. Having recently completed our first year of competing, we are proud to say we had a monumental season.</p>
<p>In December, we traveled to Chicago, IL where we soundly defeated Northwestern University, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Notre Dame and Indiana University. Leaving with the title of Big Ten Champions felt great, but getting featured on the front page of the College Squash Association’s website felt even better.</p>
<p>In January, we logged a win over Xavier University and an even bigger victory against Michigan’s greatest rival, The Ohio State University (Go Blue). With all of these matches in the books, we jumped on a plane to Boston, MA in February and made our first ever appearance at the US Collegiate Team Championships. With a ranking of #49 in the nation, we wrapped up an incredible season with three challenging matches against the country’s top club teams. </p>
<p>And the best part is we are just getting started. While Covid-19 may have us locked inside, our players continue to train every day and our executive board has been hard at work. Jeremy Waldman ‘22 and Lou Alpert ‘22 were recently appointed co-presidents of the club, with former president, Andrew Garver ‘21, taking the role of team manager and our club founder, Ryan Kish ‘21, assuming the role of strategic advisor. Additionally, Conor Hynes ‘22 will be our Team Activities Chair and Alyson Chatterjee ‘21 will continue to serve as Social Media Chair. We could not be more excited to have such a top-notch team of student-leaders dedicated to the success and longevity of this organization.</p>
<p>That is all for this month’s edition! Look out for next month’s newsletter where we will introduce our incoming recruits and share our new website that we have been hard at work designing! If you enjoyed this newsletter and think someone else would too, please forward them this email and encourage them to fill out this form (it takes less than a minute): </p>

<p>Thank you for reading and we hope you continue to stay safe and healthy!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lou Alpert ‘22</p>
<p>Co-President</p>
